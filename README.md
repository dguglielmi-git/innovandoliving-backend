# InnovandoLiving Backend Server - (e-Commerce Strapi Backend)

This project works as the backend for the E-commerce InnovandoLiving. It was designed as a monolithic system due to its small functionalities. Even though it is a small backend system, it works as a starting point for a more robust system if it's required. Feel free to modify as you wish, this project is not under any kind of license.
